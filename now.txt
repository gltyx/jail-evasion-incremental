theme: EVASION

plan:
you were sent to jail and you are trying to escape from jail

you want to avoid being sent to jail again, so you try to escape
every second, there's a chance that you will be sent to jail
you can try to increase your distance from the jail, and earn cash
cash can be used to avoid getting spotted and sent to jail
however, there can be tradeoffs between earning more cash and decreasing search effort,
as some opportunities can increase search effort but earn more cash
eventually, you can book an international flight and escape to another country
some puzzles will be included to make it more challenging

at the end, you can hire lawyers and countersue, leading to pernament escape from jail
the game ends after that

okay some more detailed ideas:

in the jail:
want to explore the jail, find exits, and solve a puzzle to exit the jail

outside of the jail: you try to escape for as long as possible
you try to look for cash, such as scavenging for cash
eventually, you get enough money such that you can leave the jail place on some vehicle
you're at the city, evasion gain increases and you need to find a place to stay
you can also work for money, although evasion gain increases while you work and after you work

you think and get ideas and boost progress
you also can buy stuff that can increase productivity
you also unlock motivation, which is a global boost to all positive effects and a reduction to evasion

eventually you get an idea for a business, which lets you gain money and XP passively, but it
also increases evasion gain massively
you can hire employees, and managers, and also buy upgrades to increase profits (generally), reduce the business
impact on evasion
you can also buy an upgrade increasing profits, but that comes at a cost of evasion multiplier

you can also hire a CEO, which also takes money passively, reducing furthermore the business impact on evasion
you can eventually unlock the option to buy a plane ticket and board a plane to head to another country, reducing evasion gain
and unlocking more features

boarding a plane requires you to solve a puzzle, which will be a graph linking nodes from the start, to intermediate nodes, to the exit
you have to travel through the intermediate nodes to reach the exit, but you can also reroll and reset your graph in case you need it (but they have cooldowns)

at the plane landing: unlock business marketing (because there's no market for product there)
at least add a paradigm shift to keep it novel
hire more employees, upgrades for marketing (but it increases evasion loss because of popularity), etc.

finally, at some amount of money, unlock lawyers
lawyers will help you contest your jail sentence
also unlock "lawyer dimensions" with each dimension being a higher tier on the judicial scale (US)
laywers also cost passive money, and generate "hours of work"

at a high enough "hours of work", "go to trial", which starts the end of the game
play another puzzle to help your lawyers obtain enough evidence to win (idk what yet)
after winning the trial, end the game with some type of modal saying you sucessfully contested your jail sentence
and is finally out of jail pernamently
maybe add some cute animation or whatnot

some safeguards:
in case evasion reaches 0, reset the entire game but give a currency that can be spent on bonuses for the next run (don't make it required)
at certain evaded points, unlock upgrades that reduce evasion loss past the evaded percentages
ALSO POLISH UI

AND ONCE AGAIN POLISH UI BECAUSE IT. SUCKS. ASS!!!!!!!!!!
